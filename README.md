# Moving Eyes Exercise 

This excercise was made in week 8 of the MIT Full Stack Developer Program.
The goal of this project was to get the pupils to follow/track the movement of 
your mouse.  


## How to run
Move mouse in any direction on the screen and watch how both 
pupils symmetrically mimic the movement of your mouse.


## Roadmap of future improvements
Being a huge Lord of the rings fan I plan to improve this project
by making the eye of sauron follow your mouse instead and make the
mouse icon appear to be the ring it follows.
